# Cpp_No_Classes
Experiment: C style coding using C++11,14,17 language features

This is just a toy project written in C style, but using features from C++11,14 and 17.  

The motivation was to use C++ type safety while maintaining the C like coding style.  
C++ has some very useful features that C doesn't like: 
  function/operator overloading,
  namespaces,
  smart pointers,
  containers,
  and templates.
  
The main goal is for me to create a sandbox or testbed for me to learn a few things along the way like more template-metaprogramming, data structures and more.

I also thought it would be neat to show the benefits of C++ over C for those that are stuck on the C coding style.
